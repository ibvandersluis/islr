# ISLR

This is a repo for labs from the book __*Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R*__ by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani (Springer, 2013).

This is not a creative work of mine in any way. This simply follows the instructions put forward in the labs.

Techniques from this book and the labs are put into practice in my [`accidents` repo](https://github.com/ibvandersluis/accidents), where I take a dataset of UK car accidents and attempt to predict fatal car crashes.

## What This Repo Contains

- __R scripts__, one for each chapter, containing all of the code for the labs
- __Comments__ in the scripts, explaining:
    - What the code does, to minimise the need to reference the text or constantly look up documentation
    - Any results I got that differed from the book
    - Any warnings I got from R after running a command
    - Any problems I ran into, and how I fixed them
- __A PDF of the text__ I used along with my highlights
- __Datasets__ for the exercises
    - Though I loaded them from the ISLR library almost every time

## R, RStudio, and OS Version Information

These labs were completed with:
- R 3.6.3 dated 29 February, 2020
- RStudio 1.2.5033 "Orange Blossom" dated 19 March, 2020

These were installed and run on my Fedora 31 computer.
